### Nashville Software School Class Project - Analysis and Report for hubNashville

For this project, the whole class worked with data provided by [hubNashville](https://hub.nashville.gov/s/?language=en_US) in order to create insights on how they could be better utilizing their time and focus. Based on discussions with hubNashville representatives, the NSS Data Analytics Team investigated the following:
* Where resources might be allocated to encourage greater online engagement with the public by looking at current trends in phone/online requests
* Current trends in service requests on a temporal basis to provide insight into appropriate staffing
* Geospatial Analyses of Trash and Covid-19 service requests  

Other interesting analyses:  
* Analysis on Property Inspector Violations reporting
* Analysis of Dead Animal Pickups
* Correlation to Police Dangerous Animal Reports

For my part in this project, I worked closely with [John Borthick](https://github.com/JohnBorthick) and [Diego Alvarez](https://github.com/diegodaa), looking at trends from 2020 in the differences between phone vs. online request based on request types. We found that other than "Quick Requests" (which are a type that only occurs during a phone call), the highest area of concentration of people calling in vs. using an online platform was the category, "Trash, Recycling & Litter."

When we further broke this category down into the provided subcategories, we found that the top three subcategories were all related to cart service.

This information is useful to Metro Nashville because it shows the areas in which they can either improve the app and website or focus their marketing for the web platforms. Influencing more people to use an online platform helps save the city money in staffing the call center.
